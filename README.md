Graphdog. Better than Graphmaster.

# What the

I know. I gimped like a pig.

So this is just a parser for my upcoming [Mud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD)BASIC interpreter. Except it works more like a chatbot than like a source code parser. The point is to make it fast and tolerant. It will just spit out the most accurate interpretation of a line of code. Since I want to write code like I make pizza, it will do.

Graphdog will be connected to [EON-Markup](https://github.com/botbreeder/eon-markup), when time comes. This is organic... a forest of giant self-shaking trees, with dancing nodes on the rhythm of a rule engine.

```Javascript

let rules = [
    {
        head: ["FOR", anything, "=", anything, "TO", anything],
        body: c => "FOR LOOP "+JSON.stringify(c)
    },
    {
        head: ["FOR", anything, "=", anything, "TO", anything, "STEP", anything],
        body: c => "FOR LOOP STEP "+JSON.stringify(c)
    },
];

let gdog = new Graphdog(rules);



console.log(
    gdog.query("for I and J = 1 to 10 step 2".split(' '))
);

```
â†“
```
FOR LOOP STEP [["I","and","J"],["1"],["10"],["2"]]
```

### _Mud?_

Why Mud you ask. Because heck, the thing is going to be [situated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situated). Situated in [Open City](https://opencity.web.app/), an in-the-pipeline Firebase-backed hackable shared environment where, if you're lucky enough, you might even meet a virtual replica of Ryan Reynolds. How cool is that.
